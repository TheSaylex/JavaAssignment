# JavaAssignment

Well, this is awkward.
GitHub has been the Bane of my college life so far.
Last year when I tried to learn to use it, it was far to unfriendly to a novice user.
this year, trying to learn to use it again, with experience. much easier.
but no less hassle free.
The first time I linked This GitHub Repo Directly into the eclipse workspace.
Then eclipse recognised that it was no longer it's own working space, and deleted the JRE System Library.
Suddenly, my Files would no longer run the Control class, as it was not recognized anything.
Not that it was a Control Class, not even the String component in the:
public static void main(String[] args)

So I thought I'd delete the repo and try to fix it.
But it was linked, so it also deleted all the files I was working on.
you know, the entire assignment. about 6 days before it was due.
I had some backups, but it was mostly scraps of code here and there that I was testing.
Enough to put the program back together like humpty dumpty.
But still, the point still stands. I understand that GitHub is an important aspect to learn.
however, It definitely feels like unintuitive, or perhaps I'm just so stupid I manage to
botch this job up so marvellously.

I've now recreated most of what I have, no thanks to GitHub and full thanks to
copious amounts of caffeine.
I've put this repository onto my desktop and made sure it stays there like a leashed dog.
Hopefully it will not bother me any more by Crushing all the work I do.
