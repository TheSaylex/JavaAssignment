They say se7en is a lucky number. I disagree, seven is a bit cliché, and I may sound a bit of
a douche to say so, but it also doesn't matter what number is percieved lucky. 
I for instance favour 8, which when laid on it's side represents infinity, two circles close together on the pixel
screen. jump in leaps, from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8, 4 digit binary. but this half a byte is also symbolized on our modern
PC as * as well as the button for 8.

Today I'm meant to go to D&D. 
Instead I deleted my Assignment and have to spend the day writing up posts to check code.
I cannot FUCKING Believe I did this to myself. But it's Okay, writing the code is easy, Planning the code is hard.
It's why I started planning since we got the assignment, even made a few paper ERD.
But I fricking deleted my Github because of what I did.

Well, The posts are laid out like thoughts on a forum.
A forum of one person though.
This seems to be a form of procrastination.
